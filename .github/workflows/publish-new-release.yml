          title: Merge master into dev branch
          body: |
            This PR merges the master branch back into dev.
            This happens to ensure that the updates that happend on the release branch, i.e. CHANGELOG and manifest updates are also present on the dev branch.

      # if needed, you can checkout the latest master here, build artifacts and publish / deploy them somewhere
      # the create-release action has an output `upload_url` output that you can use to upload assets
